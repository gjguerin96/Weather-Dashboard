# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
I built this project to better understand how to access APIs, and to learn how to build an application around the information API contains. I learned a lot about the potential APIs have when used correctly. Some APIs are not very useful, but the OpenWeather API I used in building this project is fortunately very useful. Being able to look up the current and future weather for any city is a very powerful tool.

## Usage
The user enters what city they want to find information about in the text box in the upper left corner of the screen, and then presses the search button to bring up the information. Once they have searched a city, that city will appear as a button under the search button so users can easily look up the cities they are interested in again (see screenshot). Those previously searched cities are saved to the local storage and will persist if the page is reloaded.

## Credits
I recieved assistance from my instructor, William Vasquez. I accessed weather data with the OpenWeather API.
